Pitch Profile: 

Jack has really good shapes, and profiles extremely similarly to Joey Calabretti in terms of pitch shapes (albeit a less developed version).

Could benefit from a larger velocity delta between ChangeUp and Fastball, ChangeUp is his lowest graded pitch and lowest usage pitch (known from our own internal Liquid records when he worked with us pre college) and could benefit with some coaching attention to it. 


Strength Profile: 

Jack will natively benefit from a collegiate strength program, he is a really good athlete who jumped 9 feet and 7 inches in the broad jump which was second best on the team.. A phenomenal athlete, he doesn't show any breakdown in his strength profile other than he is systematically underweight for an athlete of his height. Despite this, he still produces adequate force metrics, these will only go up with the addition of lean mass while preserving these same acceleration components. Force as an equation steams from mass times acceleration, Jack is already in the 95th percentile for these acceleration values and the lowest hanging fruit will now be the lean mass. 


Biomechanics Profile: 

At our lab in Rochester, Jack has always showed high mechanical variance with the onset of fatigue. This is normal for underdeveloped, underweight pitchers that rely on perfect mechanical variables to maximize their outputs. Essentially with this group, they get a lot out of their body by being good athletes, however when they're fatigued and can't do this, they don't have the mass backing to be able to still be somewhat similar. Jack's stride and external rotation in his shoulder have historically shown higher variance due to this fatigue, however, if we can keep that stride while adding the lean mass so that he's able to repeat this mechanics better, he does have incredible outlier extension down the mound which is only going to compliment his high vertical break fastball and increase his strikeout rates.
