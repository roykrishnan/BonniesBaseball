Pitch Profile: 

Derek Duval has an average fastball, definitely could be better by killing an inch or two or horizontal and adding an inch or two of vertical (which can be done by playing with seam orientations/grip). He'll need to command the ball well with average stuff and will benefit greatly from the addition of a tertiary pitch such as a changeup. The fastball shows us he has the ability to create horizontal movement, therefore putting him in vertically repressive grips (like the kick change) can really help add that third pitch quickly. Will do better with better pitch mixes due to average stuff. 

Strength Profile: 

Duval has a 0.86 E:C Ratio showing us he's not natively deficient in any one phase of the counter movement jump, this shows a good strength profile, where the focus should be on skill refinement. However, based on his body type, as well as the Rate of Force Development comping out of the Squat Jump (longer time to peak force than his teammates), he will natively benefit from exercises that encourage him to develop fast twitch tissue especially as the season goes on and the onset of fatigue starts to move in day to day. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Duval has a relatively compact motion and mechanically profiles well, with no major adjustments needed to the specific delivery. However, in the body velocity sector (such as knee extension velocity, how fast he is able to stabilize that front leg), he trends under the median. No immediate cause for concern, but this profile requires quick contraction work in season to ensure it doesn't trend further downwards.
