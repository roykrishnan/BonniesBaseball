Pitch Profile: 

Eamon was only going 80% (supposedly), best not to read too far into metrics at submaximal intents. ChangeUp camouflages well with the Fastball, would do better with a slightly larger speed difference (which may will naturally happen at maximum intent). Throws a high gyro slider, but would profile more strongly with a sweeper (would maximize break plot and help miss barrels more off of current Fastball ChangeUp metrics). 

Strength Profile: 

Giblin profiles well, not showing any specific strength deficiencies in testing, where he can just focus on skill refinement in his daily programming. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Giblin shows significant limitations in Torso Rotation. While his sequencing technically registers at 100%, this is misleading—the torso and pelvis are rotating almost simultaneously, with the pelvis initiating movement only microseconds earlier. This lack of true separation suggests insufficient torso contribution during the delivery. This issue is not merely a mechanical flaw on the mound, but a deeper functional limitation. Our table assessment reveals subpar spine rotation to both the right and left, indicating that Giblin’s restricted torso rotation originates from a physical deficit, not just a movement pattern. To make meaningful progress, this needs to be addressed off the mound through targeted mobility and stability work. Treating it as a functional limitation rather than just a sequencing issue will lead to more durable and transferable improvements in his mechanics.
