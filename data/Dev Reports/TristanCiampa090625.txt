Pitch Profile: 

Tristan has a polished arsenal, with all movement profiles in average to above average ranges ranges in terms of Horizontal/Vertical Break and differences in velocities. No one pitch lags behind another too greatly. Good score of total arsenal. 

Strength Profile: 

Tristan could do with more concentric strength, however, isn't necessarily lacking it (is right on the cutoff threshold for deficiency. Medium to top end in all of our force plate leaderboards. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Ciampa struggles to get into and out of Max External Rotation consistently, despite having decent range of motion in the shoulder joint on the table. The way he stays in internal rotation after hand break could be cleared up to try and consistently create a better hand path to avoid the arm being late at points. Unlike some others on staff, this isn't so much created by a breakdown lower in his mechanics, it's created by the arm circle itself (the way he breaks his hands out of his glove).
