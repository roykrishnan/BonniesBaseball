Pitch Profile: 

Justin Gottlieb is the classic average all over pitcher that can eat innings for this Bonnies Team. Will benefit from weight room significantly this offseason to be able to move his own mass quicker, only got one changeup measured (and it misread, didn't read in vertical break) so cannot grade that pitch yet. Could benefit from a 2 Seam/Sinker addition, shows the ability to throw a gyro sinker pitch with the gyro degree on slider, will have to share usage across multiple pitches to be effective (modern Sonny Gray is a good example of someone who does effectively). 


Strength Profile:

Justin Gottlieb has a high level of physical projection left to develop on the body, ranking towards the end of the spectrum in all strength leaderboards. Emphasis will be on developing more explosive ability and general athletic ability. Strong candidate for fastball velocity gain with better strength numbers. 


Biomechanics Profile: 
Gottlieb would benefit from forward tilt with the torso at ball release, struggled to get over the front leg at ball release. This might natively come with creating more force in his strength profile from the ground up, as this has a tendency to naturally move the trunk forward in ball release to normalize said force.
