Pitch Profile: 

Joey Calabretti has the highest graded RHP Fastball on this entire staff. Elite vertical break and decent velocity makes this an exceptional swing and miss, top of the zone fastball that has a solid complement with the slider. With his slot, would be advantageous and have a low learning curve to implementing a high vertically breaking curveball to add to his above average sweeper already. Splitter is okay, does a decent job or camouflaging with the Fastball, don't think there's a need to change anything as his Fastball usage should probably be pretty high (45-55%). 

Strength Profile: 

Good mover, does a good job of getting in and out of positions. Unfortunately, our testing outside of a singular test corrupted for him from a force plate POV. Can't put a ton of weight into it, but will create a profile upon retest at the end of the fall season.


Biomechanics Profile: 

Joey is in a normal range for every and all mechanical scoring components. He could do with a slightly better lead leg block to transfer energy up the kinetic chain better, this should be the number one focus in movement prep and mechanical re-patterning. Torso rotation is on the lower end, but is within normal deviation for a high slot thrower.
