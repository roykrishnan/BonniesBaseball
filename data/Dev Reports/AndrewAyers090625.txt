Pitch Profile: 

Ayers has a 'dead zone' fastball with low RPMs, and is very similar in horizontal and vertical break. He does however show the ability to create good gyro spin, as evidenced by his slider. This makes him a good candidate for a gyro sinker (12-13' horizontal break and 8-9' vertical break), which is going to play really well with his low RPM fastballs, creating a low kinetic energy pitch profile that will be harder to elevate for the hitter when located down in the zone. This coupled with his above average changeup profiles him as a strong ground ball pitcher from the left side, with a command focus down in the zone, as that will amplify all of his shapes.

Strength Profile: 

Ayers is shows concentric deficiencies in his Counter Movement Jump, signaling the need for strength programming that helps him increase explosive power and rate of force development.


Biomechanics Profile: 

Ayers shows low hip to shoulder separation at ball front foot strike, low knee extension velocity (poor lead leg block) at ball release. Globally, he needs to be able to create more power and create more strength in rotational planes (pelvis, torso).
