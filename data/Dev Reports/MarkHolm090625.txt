Pitch Profile: 

Mark Holm has the somewhat rare trait of being a higher vertical breaking fastball throwing LHP. FastBall and ChangeUp look good, would pick either the Slider or CurveBall to throw this season, there isn't a large enough difference in them to throw both as evidenced in the break plot charts to the right. Would focus on one, and really workshop it either have higher vertical or horizontal break (pick a shape and get as good at it as he can) as this third pitch is his lowest graded pitch currently. 

Strength Profile; 

Concentric Development will be a point of focus for Mark Holm, as rate of force development will be imperative to maximizing his velocity threshold. Currently, in Takeoff Peak Force in the Squat Jump, Mark lasts last. Focusing on improving this metric will allow for even better velocity development. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Mark has a high coefficient of variance in his mechanics pitch to pitch, meaning his mechanics fluctuate higher than others on the team. This is often seen in pitchers who require longer deliveries in order to generate ample force going down the mound, or guys that throw maximum effort every single pitch. Not necessarily an issue, but something to note (higher mechanical variance can lead to higher pitch variance especially once the individual is fatigued).
