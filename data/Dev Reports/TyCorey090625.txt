Pitch Profile: 

Ty will benefit from dropping to a much lower slot for two reasons. One his stuff currently isn't near Division 1 caliber, two the lower slot requires less landing force and as a result could substantially maximize his throwing career by allowing him to have a longer one as a lefty specialist. 


Strength Profile: 

No Force Plate data collected on Ty Corey 


Biomechanics Profile: 

Corey doesn't accelerate in and out of end ranges very well, one way this can be balanced out is by not getting deep into those ranges in the first place. The only way to do this and be effective would be to switch to a submarine throwing motion.
