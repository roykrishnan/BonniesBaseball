Pitch Profile: 

Tom Wilkie is going to benefit a lot more from command training more than anything else. Killing some vert on the fastball to get to 12 horizontal and sub 9 vertical wouldn't be the worst idea either. Slider's a great pitch, would just focus on getting that fastball out of the dead zone (too neutral in movement) and throwing strikes more than anything else. Slider will play even better in his arsenal if the fastball shape can be more distinct. 

Strength Profile:

Strong strength profile just requires maintenance, not specifically deficient in any one plane. However, ranked dead last in time to peak force rankings in the Hop Test, which is how quickly the legs can stabilize from a flexed start. Despite this did not have any glaring blocking issues biomechanically. Blending some jumping in daily strength programming (skate jumps, depth drop jumps etc.) could help alleviate this quickly. 


Biomechanics Profile: 

High mechanical variance as a result of the trunk being at different positions at ball release. Sometimes the trunk is further back from that landing leg, sometimes it is over it, controlling for this and patterning a consistent release point (by fixing how far/behind the trunk is at ball release) will help create a consistent slot and therefore consistent shapes/better command.
