Pitch Profile: 

Nolan grades as the most talented pitcher on this Bonnies staff in terms of Stuff and pitch ability. Low release height and good stuff is going make this profile play even better than the gradings suggest just due to hitter unfamiliarity with the low slot (especially against left handed batters). For a professional reference, Feidt shows the exact same lever heights and arm slot as Jaimie Arnold . We see pretty high correlations with weight and ability to maintain stuff later in games from our database at Liquid Sports Lab, Nolan is going to be one of the better arms in the Atlantic 10 if he can add some lean mass. Exceptional athlete, jumped 10 feet in the broad jump, which is the highest we have ever seen in Liquid Sports Lab data collection history (including professional baseball players). If he can maintain this athleticism and pitch ability while adding strength, we're looking at a future MLB Draft pick. A unicorn talent where if we can preach eating right, sleeping right, gaining strength and weight the right way and he can show 91-94 MPH from that slot at some point he's a 3rd to 5th round pick. 


Strength Profile: 

Feidt is in ideal ranges for each and every strength metric, and the major focus should simply be adding lean mass while preserving these acceleration and range of motion metrics. Jumped 10 feet is the broad jump, the highest ever recorded in NFL combine history is 12 feet 7 inches, and this is simply just showcases Nolan's elite athletic ability. Number one on almost every force plate metric that doesn't take body weight into account. Only major change that'll benefit him is getting even stronger and conserving these elite ranges of motion/power ratios.
