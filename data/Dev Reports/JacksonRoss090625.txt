Pitch Profile: 

Jackson Ross provides the perfect complement on this right side to Conor Wolf after he can kill vertical break on his fastball, which should be his number one offseason goal. Jack Kelly, Joey Calibretti, Enger Paulino etc. are already higher profiling vertical break fastball throwers from the right side, so to add bullpen diversity Ross will benefit more substantially by being a high horizontal break fastball option out of the pen. ChangeUp could also benefit from more sparation between horizontal and vertical (higher horizontal, less vertical to match new Fastball profile), Slider is an okay high gyro pitch. After arsenal recomposition, could be strong ground ball inducer from the right side. Will grade high Stuff+ wise, due to his ability to create a foot plus of break on his primary pitch, now needs to be able to create better separation to realize that potential fully.

Strength Profile: 

Ross shows concentric deficiencies in his Counter Movement Jump, having one of the lower E:C Ratios of the team. He will need to develop explosive power and increase his rate of force development and this should be addressed in his daily programming. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Ross doesn't sequence effectively, with his torso out rotating his pelvis from the first linear move down the mound. Getting his hips to rotate first, then his torso should be the primary goal of any mechanical repatterning this offseason.
