Pitch Profile: 

Conor Wolf has a true sweep profile, with strong horizontal break on his fastball and slider, as well as his changeup. Getting fastball velocity up, while creating a larger separation between his changeup and fastball (as to not speed up bats) is going to be imperative for him to profile as a stronger arm. At 165 lbs, and as someone who already possesses good arsenal shapes, he's biggest development focus should be the addition of lean mass while building strength and preserving acceleration, hopefully increasing his fastball velocity while maintaining its shape. 

Strength Profile: 

Wolf has the lowest E:C Ratio on the team at 0.33, profiling him as concentrically deficient with the need to add explosive power and rate of force development. This is partly due to being systematically underweight for a college pitcher. Big emphasis on adding lean mass in the offseason will help drive this number up. Upper half seems to be underdeveloped with his plyo pushup being the worst we measured (in terms of total force) on the team. 

Biomechanics Profile: 

Wolf's biomechanics profile remains true to his strength profile, as he has good velocities in accelerating in and out of positions due to a slender and athletic frame. These accelerations ideally should be preserved while adding lean mass, allowing for a higher force delta. Trunk Rotation in comparison to his arm angle & horizontal abduction values creates a somewhat pushy arm action that could be better improved by matching his arm slot to his shoulder rotation (or vice versa).
