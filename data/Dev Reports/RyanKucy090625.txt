Pitch Profile: 

Great break plot, classic low slot arm, drop even fractionally lower to see how close to that zero line we can get these pitches (he threw a couple that got there perfectly, even got. Little negative). Good case for a universal target here for easy tunneling. Important to build strength in lower planes this offseason. Essentially he will get a lot more from exercises like barbell benching, pec flies, etc. since he's got a lower slot, need to make sure his movement is tailored to support that lower slot. Arm angle can tend to drift up on fastballs, specific emphasis should be made to keep the slot low for all pitches. 


Strength Profile: 

Kucy shows concentric deficiencies, these won't matter as much for a pitcher who doesn't utilize the ground as well (which lower slot guys don't natively do as well), however will benefit him to be able to create for explosive force as he ranks towards the bottom there in all of our force plate leaderboards. Has good recruitment of muscle fiber as his time to peak force ranks third on the team. Being at the bottom of the plyo pushup leaderboards is a little more concerning as lower slot guys will natively need more 'pushing' strength out of a need for increased active internal rotation of the arm, as their arm motion more matches the plane of a pushup than a throw. Specific overall focuses on concentric force additions in the upper and lower body will pay large dividends here as well as make it easier to maintain that lower slot he has as he fatigues. 


Biomechanics Profile. 

Kucy's torso rotates before his pelvis, this is the usually indicative of players who have recently switched to throwing out of a lower slot, or throwing with a lower slot off of the mound and are having trouble sequencing. Specific daily programming should be constructed to ensure that despite the low slot, he is able toe to mobilize his lower body before his trunk. Everything else is in a relatively normal range.
